## Welcome to White Label Digital Twins

A Digital Twin (DT) is a comprehensive software representation of an individual physical asset (PA) or physical twin (PT). 
It includes the properties, conditions, relationships, and behavior(s) of the real-life object through models and data. 
A Digital Twin is a set of realistic models that can digitalize an object’s behavior in the deployed environment and has the responsibility 
to represent and reflect its physical counterpart over time maintaining its digital replica across the object’s entire lifecycle.

The White Label Digital Twin (WLDT) library aims to support the design, development, and deployment of Digital Twins 
within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The library has been designed following the latest DT definitions 
coming from both Industrial and Scientific domains and identifying DTs as active, flexible and scalable software components.
