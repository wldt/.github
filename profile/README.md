## Welcome to White Label Digital Twins

The White Label Digital Twin (WLDT) library aims to support the design, development, and deployment of Digital Twins (DTs) 
within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The library has been designed following the latest DT definitions 
coming from both Industrial and Scientific domains and identifying DTs as active software components. 

The Digital Twin definition that we use as a reference for the upcoming definition and the library's architecture and main 
modules are the following:

```text
A Digital Twin (DT) is a comprehensive software representation of an individual physical asset (PA). 
It includes the properties, conditions, relationships, and behavior(s) of the real-life object through models and data. 
A Digital Twin is a set of realistic models that can digitalize an object’s behavior in the deployed environment. 
The Digital Twin represents and reflects its physical twin and remains its virtual counterpart across the object’s entire lifecycle.
```
